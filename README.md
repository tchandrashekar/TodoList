# TodoList
Todo Application using springboot

This is a spring boot basic application where it contains just todo items and where the task is completed or not is said using the boolean values if the value us true then the taskmis completed other wise it has to be done.

This project works on the localhost . I have'nt  applied any html to webpages it works on the http requests only.
